It’s been quite a journey. I started by brushing off my rusty JavaScript skills (the last time I wrote anything in JavaScript was probably 2015), sat myself in a crash course on React.js, sat myself in another crash course in gatsby.js, and started working through templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this template here, which was developed by Alexander Shelepenok: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen&quot;&gt;Link to Repository&lt;/a&gt;. I came across it, as I was looking at Victor Zhou’s website on ML, and various projects (&lt;a href=&quot;https://victorzhou.com/&quot;&gt;Victor Zhou’s Website&lt;/a&gt;). However, the template was far too complicated for my needs. It had several features that I don’t really need with this blog (yet). Those were things such as CMS compatibility, a docker deployment system, flow, jest (for testing, though I’ll eventually need that), and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I came across this much more simple template here, which I was able to navigate much easier: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog&quot;&gt;Link to Repository&lt;/a&gt;. It was developed by Kyle Matthews, the founder of Gatsby.js. It’s much more bare-bones, and I’m planning on using my knowledge of React.js and Gatsby.js to rework this site to be more than just a blog, but a showcase of the work I’ve done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this will be a long ongoing project that I’m working on, but I hope this site will take it’s form soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, every blog post, I’m thinking of featuring one of the many film photos I took during my time in the Philippines, so here’s one for you now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular Pages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular pages, that is, hard-coded pages (such as index.html and 404.html) are stored in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/pages/&lt;/code&gt;. Gatsby recognizes this, and these are compiled when &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby deploy&lt;/code&gt; is run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog Pages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blog pages are not created individually. A template exists in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/templates/blog-post.js&lt;/code&gt; and the functions (made using a Node API) written in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-node.js&lt;/code&gt; create the pages dynamically by using a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;GraphQL&lt;/code&gt; query to query the blog posts from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/content/blog&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: “Node” is the name associated with all data added to Gatsby. I’m actually not too sure how this works. inside &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-node.js&lt;/code&gt;, there exists an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;exports.onCreateNode()&lt;/code&gt; function, which I don’t fully understand. I tried looking into the documentation, but couldn’t find much on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does the template work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The template takes in three sources of data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
an object that contains query data within src/templates/blog-post.js. This is passed in when GraphQL is run within the same javascript file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pageContext&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
an object that contains data passed from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-node.js&lt;/code&gt; This is passed as the context object in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;creatContext()&lt;/code&gt; inside of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-node.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
an object that contains &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does gatsby-node.js pass data?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It uses Node API, exposed through the “exports” object. In particular, the blog uses the createPages method. This method takes in the parameters graphQL and actions from the object passed in (the template uses object deconstruction syntax).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within that, a GraphQL query &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Beginnings]]></title><description><![CDATA[Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and

&lt;h2&gt;On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This however showed weasel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well uncritical so misled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is very interesting&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Goodness much until that fluid owl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the &lt;strong&gt;Italic Mountains&lt;/strong&gt;, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown &lt;em&gt;Bookmarksgrove&lt;/em&gt;, the headline of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Alphabet Village&lt;/a&gt; and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rhetoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Longe and Parole&lt;/a&gt; and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove

&lt;p&gt;It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
would be the word “and” and the Little Blind Text should turn around and
return to its own, safe country.&lt;/p&gt;
