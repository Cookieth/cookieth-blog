I’ve recently taught myself how to set up this blog. It’s been quite a journey. I started by brushing off my rusty JavaScript skills (the last time I wrote anything in JavaScript was probably 2015), sat myself in a crash course on React.js, sat myself in another crash course in gatsby.js, and started working through templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this template here, which was developed by Alexander Shelepenok: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen&quot;&gt;Link to Repository&lt;/a&gt;. I came across it, as I was looking at Victor Zhou’s website on ML, and various projects (&lt;a href=&quot;https://victorzhou.com/&quot;&gt;Victor Zhou’s Website&lt;/a&gt;). However, the template was far too complicated for my needs. It had several features that I don’t really need with this blog (yet). Those were things such as CMS compatibility, a docker deployment system, flow, jest (for testing, though I’ll eventually need that), and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I came across this much more simple template here, which I was able to navigate much easier: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog&quot;&gt;Link to Repository&lt;/a&gt;. It was developed by Kyle Matthews, the founder of Gatsby.js. It’s much more bare-bones, and I’m planning on using my knowledge of React.js and Gatsby.js to rework this site to be more than just a blog, but a showcase of the work I’ve done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this will be a long ongoing project that I’m working on, but I hope this site will take it’s form soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;

Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named
Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This however showed weasel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well uncritical so misled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is very interesting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goodness much until that fluid owl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the &lt;strong&gt;Italic Mountains&lt;/strong&gt;, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown &lt;em&gt;Bookmarksgrove&lt;/em&gt;, the headline of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Alphabet Village&lt;/a&gt; and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rhetoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Longe and Parole&lt;/a&gt; and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So baboon this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mounted militant weasel gregariously admonishingly straightly hey&lt;/li&gt;

back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet
Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rhetoric
question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a
copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
would be the word “and” and the Little Blind Text should turn around and
return to its own, safe country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that “despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich.”?

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I didn’t either.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
