I’ve recently taught myself how to set up this blog. It’s been quite a journey. I started by brushing off my rusty JavaScript skills (the last time I wrote anything in JavaScript was probably 2015), sat myself in a crash course on React.js, sat myself in another crash course in gatsby.js, and started working through templates.</p>\n<p>I found this template here, which was developed by Alexander Shelepenok: <a href=\"https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen\">Link to Repository</a>. I came across it, as I was looking at Victor Zhou’s website on ML, and various projects (<a href=\"https://victorzhou.com/\">Victor Zhou’s Website</a>). However, the template was far too complicated for my needs. It had several features that I don’t really need with this blog (yet). Those were things such as CMS compatibility, a docker deployment system, flow, jest (for testing, though I’ll eventually need that), and more.</p>\n<p>So, I came across this much more simple template here, which I was able to navigate much easier: <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog\">Link to Repository</a>. It was developed by Kyle Matthews, the founder of Gatsby.js. It’s much more bare-bones, and I’m planning on using my knowledge of React.js and Gatsby.js to rework this site to be more than just a blog, but a showcase of the work I’ve done.</p>\n<p>Of course, this will be a long ongoing project that I’m working on, but I hope this site will take it’s form soon.</p>\n<p>Until next time,</p>\n<p>Keith Choa</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello, World!","date":"April 30, 2020","description":"My process of setting up this blog"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hello-world/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/new-beginnings/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings"}},"next":null}}}
