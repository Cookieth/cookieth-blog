I started by brushing off my rusty JavaScript skills (the last time I wrote anything in JavaScript was probably 2015), sat myself in a crash course on React.js, sat myself in another crash course in gatsby.js, and started working through templates.</p>\n<p>I found this template here, which was developed by Alexander Shelepenok: <a href=\"https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen\">Link to Repository</a>. I came across it, as I was looking at Victor Zhou’s website on ML, and various projects (<a href=\"https://victorzhou.com/\">Victor Zhou’s Website</a>). However, the template was far too complicated for my needs. It had several features that I don’t really need with this blog (yet). Those were things such as CMS compatibility, a docker deployment system, flow, jest (for testing, though I’ll eventually need that), and more.</p>\n<p>So, I came across this much more simple template here, which I was able to navigate much easier: <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog\">Link to Repository</a>. It was developed by Kyle Matthews, the founder of Gatsby.js. It’s much more bare-bones, and I’m planning on using my knowledge of React.js and Gatsby.js to rework this site to be more than just a blog, but a showcase of the work I’ve done.</p>\n<p>Of course, this will be a long ongoing project that I’m working on, but I hope this site will take it’s form soon.</p>\n<p>Also, every blog post, I’m thinking of featuring one of the many film photos I took during my time in the Philippines, so here’s one for you now:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/cookieth-blog/static/eea057106a41c93a0cf407a10e5ede43/f0881/000011.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.89189189189189%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Observing Silence seems to be all we&#39;re doing lately\"\n        title=\"Observing Silence seems to be all we&#39;re doing lately\"\n        src=\"/cookieth-blog/static/eea057106a41c93a0cf407a10e5ede43/1c72d/000011.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/cookieth-blog/static/eea057106a41c93a0cf407a10e5ede43/a80bd/000011.jpg 148w,\n/cookieth-blog/static/eea057106a41c93a0cf407a10e5ede43/1c91a/000011.jpg 295w,\n/cookieth-blog/static/eea057106a41c93a0cf407a10e5ede43/1c72d/000011.jpg 590w,\n/cookieth-blog/static/eea057106a41c93a0cf407a10e5ede43/a8a14/000011.jpg 885w,\n/cookieth-blog/static/eea057106a41c93a0cf407a10e5ede43/fbd2c/000011.jpg 1180w,\n/cookieth-blog/static/eea057106a41c93a0cf407a10e5ede43/f0881/000011.jpg 3637w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Until next time,</p>\n<p>Keith Choa</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello, World!","date":"April 30, 2020","description":"A short note on my process of setting up this blog.
